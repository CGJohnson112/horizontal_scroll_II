# horizontal_scroll_II
Horizontal landing page concept design using a GIF and formatted images 
Best viewed in phone view on Google developer, although it is web responsive. Links do not work, purely coded as a quick reference concept template for front end.
Specific uses for this layout involve landing pages, gallery/photography intensive sites where images are important.
