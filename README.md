# horizontal_scroll_II
Horizontal landing page concept design using a GIF and formatted images 
Best viewed in phone view on Google developer, although it is web responsive. Links do not work, purely coded as a quick reference concept template for front end. Can clone this directly to your desktop and run on your browswer to watch it in action. 

Use your mouse jog wheel to scroll the page left and right. 

Specific uses for this layout involve landing pages, gallery/photography intensive sites where images are important.
